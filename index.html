    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <img src="Images/Professional%20picture.PNG">
    <p>I'm a transfer student from Truman College, where I obtained an associate's degree. Two of my biggest hobbies are to code android applications and play videogames online with my coworkers and friends. Even though those are two of my biggest hobbies. I currently work at JPMorgan Chase as a software engineer, that's where I spend most of my time everyday. </p>
    <h3>A little bit about where I work</h3>
    <img src="Images/jpmorgan.JPG">
    <p>I work for the Corporate and Investment Bank line of business of JPMorgan Chase & Co (this is the opposite of consumer bank Chase). More specifically, I'm in the service improvement team of production management within the Corporate and Investment Bank. Funny fact about our application is that we, the developers, are also the production management team (and we are considered a "DevOps" team). We use HTML, CSS, and AngularJS Bootstrap for the frontend. Now, for the backend part of the application we use SpringBoot Java, SQL queries for databases, Python for a machine learning script, Kubernetes for automating the script execution, and Apache Groovy for automating builds and releases.</p>
